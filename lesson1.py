# introduction to python 
# variables-is a container that store values.
# rules of naming variables 
# 1.must not start with numbers (e.g 1fruit,2counties) 
# 2.case sensitive e.g age and AGE are not the same variables 
# 3. not to use python reserved keyword eg else ,if 
# 4.use unerscores to separate a variable in stead of using spaces egfirst_name instead of first name



#  varible naming conventions
# 1.snake case -is where words are delimited with an underscore
# eg first_name,variable_one,country_one

# 2.pascal case -name are delimited with a capital letter
# eg FirstName,LastName,

# 3.camel case-this is where words are delimited with capital case except the initial word
# eg firstName,secondName,myCountry






age =25
print(age)

myCountry= "kenya"
print(myCountry)

# print a message to your loved one 

myLove='I LOVE YOU MY DEAREST'
print(myLove)


# concatination 
age=25
message="this is my message"
print("my age is age",age)
print("my message is:",message)
